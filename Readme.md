# VCS Introduction :


**What is Version Control :- **

Version control is a system which tracks changes to a file or a group of files/source code.This helps us to switch to/track different versions of the application that we are developing. All the changes/versions are recorded in a repository.

VCS helps us maintain a detailed history of the project as well as the ability to work on different versions of it. Having a detailed history of a project is important because it lets us see the progress of the project over time.


**Repository :-**

It is a space to store all of your projects/source code.It can be local to a folder or on an online host (GitHub)


**Advantages of using a VCS :-**


1. A detailed history of all the versions of the source code are preserved. 
2. Shared workspace and real-time updates.
3. It is easier to rollback to previous versions.
4. Reverse faulty updates
5. Analyse and Compare different versions


**Types of VCS :-**


    1. **Local VCS**:- 
    2. **Centralised VCS :-**
        1. A centralised VCS is a central copy of our project on the server.
        2. Several programmers then access the source code on the Sever and update a specific file / commit changes in the project directory.
        3. All the changes made by the users are stored on the central server.

    4. **Distributed VCS :-**
        1. These systems do not necessarily rely on a central server to store all the versions of a project’s files. Instead, every developer “clones” a copy of a repository and has the full history of the project on their own hard drive. This copy (or “clone”) has all of the metadata of the original.
        2. The act of getting new changes from a repository is usually called “pulling,” and the act of moving your own changes to a repository is called “pushing”.
